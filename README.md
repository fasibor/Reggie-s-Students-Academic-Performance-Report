# Reggie's Students Academic Performance Report

![Task-35B-Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8fa48ee-1ec8-44c4-9f9a-842f32053f72)


## Overview
This analysis evaluates academic performance using key metrics such as exam scores, attendance, and study habits, with a focus on influencing factors like tutoring support, gender, region, and parental education.  
It explores how these variables impact outcomes, identifies performance disparities, and uncovers the most effective combinations of attributes contributing to academic success. The goal is to inform strategies that uplift underperforming groups and drive better educational results.


## Objectives
- Evaluate how study habits, attendance, and tutoring affect academic performance  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming student groups  
- Pinpoint disparities across gender, region, and parental education  
- Uncover impactful attribute combinations linked to high achievement  
- Enable data-driven decision-making for educational improvement


## Why This Project is Useful
In an age where education must be inclusive and effective, understanding what drives student success is vital. This analysis provides insights that:
- Reveal patterns tied to academic achievement  
- Highlight the critical impact of attendance, tutoring, and study habits  
- Guide strategic interventions in underperforming regions  
- Support gender- and region-sensitive educational reforms  
- Influence parental engagement, policy direction, and school resource planning


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Students:** 4,000  
- **Average Attendance:** 75.22%  
- **Average Hours Studied/Week:** 9.86  
- **Average Exam Score:** 71.11  



## Key Observations
- Students who received tutoring consistently scored higher, especially urban females (avg. score > 82).  
- High study group (13 hrs/week) averaged 83, while low study group (3hrs/week) averaged only 46.  
- Students with good attendance scored 75 on average, compared to 65 for poor attendance.  
- Urban students outperformed rural ones both in attendance (75% vs. 69%) and exam scores (72 vs. 69).  
- Children of parents with tertiary education scored 73, while those with no formal education scored 68.  
- Females slightly outnumbered males in the high-performing category.

## Recommendations
1. Expand access to tutoring, particularly in rural areas, through online tutoring platforms or community learning hubs.  
2. Introduce structured study skill programs and time management workshops, especially for low study-hour students.  
3. Implement attendance-based rewards or stipends to reduce absenteeism, especially in underperforming regions.  
4. Launch parent education initiatives, such as training sessions or learning toolkits, to empower parents to support their children regardless of education level.  
5. Invest in mobile digital classrooms and improved infrastructure for rural learners to level the learning environment.  
6. Develop male-focused engagement programs, using gamified learning or interest-based content to keep boys academically motivated.  



## Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates how analyzing the relationship between academic performance and influencing factors can drive meaningful change.  
With the right insights, educators and policymakers can design targeted interventions, reduce performance gaps, and foster academic success for all students.
